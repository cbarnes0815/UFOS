# UFOS

## Overview of Project:
- Dana was provided with a data.js file containing 111 UFO sightings recorded over time.
- Dana had to create a webpage on UFO sightings using the data that was provided and allows users to filter through UFO sighting cases as a dynamic table
- Dana had to provide multiple filters(date, city, state, country, shape) for users to manupulate and allows them to analyze the data. This allows the table to be catergorized as "dynamic"
- The link for the javascript is:
- The link for the HTML is:

## Results

- The UFO webpage (HTML file) will be used to filter the data presented in the table.
- The webpage is coded to display multiple filters which users will want to use to display certain sightings that falls in a certain criteria.
For example: Below users can type in any filter boxes or all filter boxes to bring up a certain list on sightings within certain perimeter

# Summary

Displaying information could be very useful and user friendly for a company  is there are multiple departments using the webpage. A major draw back of this specific webpage is Case sensitivity. If it is not an exact match as "us" as opposed to "US" then no results will show. 
Some recommendations for optimization would be: 
- Having a dropdown menu for the filters as opposed to users typing it in.
- Displaying a map of all the UFO sightings in the US and allowing users to click on the location of the map and the query be executed that way.
